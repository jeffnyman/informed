# Informed

This repository is a companion to my [Informing](https://github.com/jeffnyman/informing) repository. What this repository provides are worked examples that utilize the tooling from the Informing repository. This allows me to present examples that demonstrate features in a way distinct from the tooling itself and thus allow you to explore the Inform ecosystem more broadly.
